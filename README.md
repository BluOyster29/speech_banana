# Speech Banana 

The following project is an addition to an instalation by Monika Balu at Frilagret in Gothenburg. 

The program takes in a string and returns a string that is an equivelence of what Monika can hear, as due to a hearing disability, certain letters, she is not able to hear. 

The program also collects anonymised and timestamped strings from the user and saves to csv
